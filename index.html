            <p>Hii Vladii,</p>
            <p>By the time youâ€™re reading this, baka obvious na sayo HAHAHA pero gusto ko pa rin sabihin ng buo at 
              malinaw. I donâ€™t even know how to start this without sounding super shy HAHAHA  anyways uhm yeahh, 
              thank you for being you, for always being patient and sweet with me, for caring in ways I didnâ€™t 
              even expect, and for making me smile kahit simpleng bagay lang, you made me feel safe, happy, 
              and loved.</p>
            <p>Every little thing you do, yung concern mo, yung clingy side mo, even yung corny jokes mo HAHAHA
              lahat yun sobrang special sakin and I really appreciate na hindi ka napapagod mag effort and yeah 
              I just want you to know na ikaw yung reason why my days feel lighter and better.</p>
            <p>And kung alam mo lang HAHAHA every time na manonood ako ng romance, ikaw agad yung naiisip at naiimagine ko
              like what did you do to me bebi? AHHA anyways yk at first I thought I just liked you, pero habang tumatagal, 
              habang mas nakikilala kita, I realized Iâ€™ve really fallen for you. Little by little, everything you did made 
              me fall in love with you. I didnâ€™t expect it to happen this way, pero here I am, telling you na Iâ€™m in love 
              with you, Vlad bebi. (â‰§â–½â‰¦)</p>
            <p>And bebi, I also love how natural it feels kapag kasama kita, kahit simpleng chat lang or kahit hindi 
              nagcocommunicate buong araw. Parang everythingâ€™s just easier and happier when youâ€™re around in my thoughts. 
              I catch myself smiling for no reason, and yepp, 99% of the time yun dahil saâ€™yo HAHAHA.</p>
            <p>I also want you to know, kahit minsan awkward or shy ako, every moment with you feels worth it. You make me 
              want to be better, not just for myself, but for us too. And the thought na may someone like you na genuinely 
              cares and notices even the tiniest thingâ€¦ grabe, it means the world to me.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being you, for letting me feel this way, and for slowly taking a very big part of my 
              heart without even trying. I hope I can make you feel just as special, every single day, bebi. â™¡</p>
            <p>So yeahh, I guess what Iâ€™m really trying to say isâ€¦ I love you, Vlad. â™¡ I love everything about you, yung 
              kadaldalan mo, yung way mo tumawa, yung paraan mo magpakita ng concern, yung small things na para sa iba baka 
              normal lang, pero saâ€™yo sobrang special. And I canâ€™t wait for more moments with you, more laughs, more corny jokes, 
              more us hehe.</p>
            <p>I hope this makes you smile like you make me smile every day. And just so you knowâ€¦ Iâ€™m all yours, bebi. (Â´â–½`Êƒâ™¡Æª)</p>
